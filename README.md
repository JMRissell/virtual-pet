Virtual Pet 1.0 description:

User selects a name for their pet. The pet is born with random "genes" and specific attributes (eg. hunger or boredom).
The user is instructed to keep all of these attributes below 100 or else the pet will die. The user can decrease these attributes by
feeding their pet to decrease hunger or playing with their pet to decrease boredom etc. Each user action increases the pet's age by 6 horus 
as well as increasing all of the attributes by the predetermined random "genes". If the pet gets close to 100 it will inform you 
what it needs. The user can also view the current levels of the pet when desired at the cost of using a user action. 
The goal is to keep our pet alive as long as possible!
